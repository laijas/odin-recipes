    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>Bara Instructions</p>
            <ol>
                <li> In a medium bowl, add flour, baking powder, salt, yeast, turmeric and sugar.</li>
                <li>Add lukewarm water gradually and mix to form a very soft, slightly sticky dough. Do not over knead.</li>
                <li>Rub the dough with oil, cover and set aside to rest, 1 hour minimum, or until doubled, 6 hours or overnight.
                    <br/> The longer it rests, the softer the bara--6 hours is perfect, but 1 hour is okay.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 16 balls. Cover and allow it to raise another hour or until doubled.
                    <br/><img src="../img/Trinidad-Doubles-bara-balls.jpg" width="200" alt="Trinidad-Doubles-bara-balls"></li>
                <li>Rub oil on a flat surface or plate. Place the dough on the oiled surface and flatten to a 6" round (oil
                    <br/>hands as well) or almost transparent. Make to your desired thickness and width, keeping in mind it puffs
                    <br/>up as it cooks</li>
                <li>Meanwhile heat oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, gently place dough in hot
                    <br/>oil and fry on each side until cooked and golden brown (takes seconds if the oil is hot enough. Drain on
                    <br/>the side of the pot, using the spoon.
                    <br/><img src="../img/Trinidad-Doubles-frying-bara.jpg" width="200" alt="Trinidad-Doubles-frying-bara"></li>
                <li>Place the fried dough (bara) in paper towel or clean kitchen towel, stacking them on each other as they are
                    <br/>done frying. This will allow them to flatten, steam and give them the soft, chewy texture we all love.
                    <br/>Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve hot with Doubles channa below.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Channa Instructions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak chickpeas overnight with 1/2 tsp baking soda. Drain and rinse with several changes of water. Drain
                    <br/>again.</li>
                <li>In a pot, add about 6 cups of water and place over medium heat. Add channa, 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp baking 
                    <br/>soda and stir to combine> bring to a boil and scoop out any impurities that rise to the top. Adding more
                    <br/>baking soda than this will give it a weird metallic baking powder taste.</li>
                <li>When chickpeas are tender, about 1 hour, add minced bandhania, minced garlic and turmeric and mix well. You
                    <br/>can also add minced hot pepper.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook for 15-20 mins or longer if required. During this time, with a wooden spoon, stir, moving
                    <br/> back and forth motion to bring it to the right consistency. This will take several minutes for the channa
                    <br/>to thicken, so be patient. Doubles will be ready soon!
                    <br/><img src="../img/Trinidad-Doubles-channa-recipe.jpg" width="200" alt="Trinidad-Doubles-channa-recipe"></li>
                    <li>Taste for salt and add more if required. To finish, mix in bandhania, amchar massala or ground roasted cumin
                    <br/>or a combination.
                    <br/>Enjoy with the baras! Can be made ahead, a day before. Can be easily doubled.

        <p>Chutney</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the cucumber chutney, mix all ingredients to combine. Taste and add salt and black pepper if required.</li>
                <li>To make the bandhania chutney, place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse to combine. Add 
                    <br/>salt to your preference. You will need to add water if making it in a blender, just enough to combine.</li>
            </ol>
