                <li>salt and white pepper <em>(to taste)</em></li>
                <li>4 to 6 oz. fresh mung bean sprouts</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the beef and marinade ingredients and marinate for about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Some fresh rice noodles come as large sheets, while others are already cut. If you have the sheets, slice the
                    <br/>rice noodles so they're about 1 inch wide. If the noodles are very stiff and stuck together, bring a wok full
                    <br/>of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Blanch them for 30 seconds to loosen. Transfer to an ice bath and
                    <br/>drain thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Heat your wok over high heat until smoking, and add 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to coat the wok. Add the beef
                    <br/>and sear until browned. As long as your wok is hot enough, the meat shouldn't stick. Set aside. Add 1 1/2
                    <br/>tablespoons more vegetable oil to the wok. Add the ginger to infuse the oil with its rich flavor for about
                    <br/>15 seconds. Add the scallions.</li>
                <li>Spread the noodles evenly in the wok and stir-fry on high for about 15 seconds. Add the Shaoxing wine
                    <br/>around the perimeter of the wok.</li>
                <li>Next, add the sesame oil, soy sauces, pinch of sugar and the seared beef. Stir-fry, making sure your metal
                    <br/>wok spatula scrapes the bottom of the wok. Lift the noodles in an upward motion to mix well and coat
                    <br>them evenly with the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add a bit of salt and white pepper to taste (taste the noodles before adding salt). Add the bean sprouts and 
                    <br/>stir-fry until they are just tender. Serve!</li>
            </ol>
    <h3>Tips & Notes:</h3>
    A useful tip is to freeze the beef before slicing, until it's firm but not solid. This makes slicing the beef much easier!
    <br/><br/> Important: Heat should remain as high as possible at all times when cooking this dish.
